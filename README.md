# Hello AI: MNIST Digit Classifier

A beginner-friendly PyTorch project that trains a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.  
This project is part of my AI portfolio to demonstrate hands-on model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
- PyTorch neural network from scratch
- Live accuracy tracking
- Matplotlib visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook for full walkthrough
